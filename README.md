# Bugzilla-Voting-Asistance
Web Extension for user-friendly, one-click voting on Mozilla Bugzilla

Replacing original messy, abstruse voting flow (_Vote_ → _Select checkbox_ → _Send form_ → _Go back to issue page_) with brand new, automagic, shiny _Click to vote_ button.

## Features:
1. [x] Making and revoking votes without leaving page
2. [x] Vote count per issue, avaliable votes per project
3. [x] Should work in any browser compatible with Web Extensions (releases for Firefox, Chrome/-ium, Opera soon)

## Todo:
1. [ ] Exceptions handling (network errors, expired session, voting quota exceeded etc.)
2. [ ] Sending votes in queue (prevents losing votes during simultaneous lists exchanges)
3. [ ] Marketpaces and promo
